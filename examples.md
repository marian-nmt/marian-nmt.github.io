## Basic examples

* **[Translating with Amun](/usecases/translating/)**:
The files and scripts described in this section can be found in `amunmt/examples/translate`. They demonstrate how to translate with Amun using Edinburgh's German-English WMT2016 single model and ensemble. 
* **[Training with Marian](/usecases/training/)**: The files
and scripts described in this section can be found in
`amunmt/examples/training`. They have been adapted from the Romanian-English sample 
from <https://github.com/rsennrich/wmt16-scripts>. We also add the back-translated data from <http://data.statmt.org/rsennrich/wmt16_backtranslations/> as desribed in 
[Edinburgh's WMT16 paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-2323). The resulting system should be competitive 
or even slightly better than reported in that paper.

## Use cases

* **[Winning system of the WMT 2016 APE shared task](/usecases/postedit/)**: This page provides data and model files for our shared task winning APE system described in [Log-linear Combinations of Monolingual and Bilingual Neural Machine Translation Models for Automatic Post-Editing](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-2378).
