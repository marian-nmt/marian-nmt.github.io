## Recommended software

### GPU version

For Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 LTS the standard packages should work. On newer versions
of Ubuntu, there may be problems due to incompatibilities of the default g++
compiler and CUDA. Minimal requirements:

 - CMake 3.5.1
 - GCC/G++ 5.4
 - CUDA 9.0 or newer

Notes:

* CUDA 10.0+ requires CMake 3.12.2+ due to some bugs in earlier versions
* Compiling the web-server tool requires also Boost 1.65.1+


### CPU version

A Marian CPU build requires [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl)
(recommended) or [OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/).
It can be enabled by adding `-DCOMPILE_CPU=on` to the CMake command.


### Ubuntu packages

Assuming a fresh Ubuntu LTS installation with CUDA, the following packages need to be
installed to compile Marian with minimal dependencies:

* Ubuntu 18.04 (or newer) + CUDA 9.2 (the default is gcc 7.3.0):

      sudo apt-get install git cmake build-essential

* Ubuntu 16.04 + CUDA 9.2 (gcc 5.4.0):

      sudo apt-get install git cmake build-essential zlib1g-dev


Additional [packages](/docs/#ubuntu-packages) can be installed to compile
Marian with the web server, built-in SentencePiece and TCMalloc support.


## Installation

Clone a fresh copy from github:

    git clone https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian

The project is a standard CMake out-of-source build, which on Linux can be compiled by executing the
following commands:

    mkdir marian/build
    cd marian/build
    cmake ..
    make -j4

If run for the first time, this will also download several submodule repositories.

For details on installation under Windows see [the documentation](/docs/#compilation-on-windows).


## Running Marian

### Training

Marian is the training framework of Marian. Assuming `corpus.en` and
`corpus.ro` are corresponding and preprocessed files of a English-Romanian
parallel corpus, the following command will create a Nematus-compatible neural
machine translation model.

    ./marian/build/marian \
      --train-sets corpus.en corpus.ro \
      --vocabs vocab.en vocab.ro \
      --model model.npz

See the [documentation](/docs/#training) for more details or the
[examples](/examples/#examples) of how to train different models with Marian.

### Translation

If a trained model is available, run:

    echo "This is a test." | ./marian/build/marian-decoder -m model.npz -v vocab.en vocab.ro

For translation on CPU, add `--cpu-threads N` (assuming Marian has been
compiled with CPU support):

    echo "This is a test." | ./marian/build/marian-decoder -m model.npz -v vocab.en vocab.ro --cpu-threads 1

See the [documentation](/docs/#translation) for more details or the
[examples](/examples/#examples) of how to use Edinburgh's WMT models for
translation.
